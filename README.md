# Angular and GraphQL API Demo â€” Movie Catalog

This is an app that demonstrates how to use Angular and the [Atlas GraphQL API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/graphql/?utm_campaign=stanimira_vlaeva&utm_source=github&utm_medium=github).

You can also take a look at the supporting Google Slides presentation: [Practical Introduction to GraphQL](https://bit.ly/mdb-graphql).

Register for [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register?utm_campaign=stanimira_vlaeva&utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral) and create a forever-free cluster!

## Usage

Update the `src/environments/environment.ts` file with your own keys:

```ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  APP_ID: '<your-app-id>',
  GRAPHQL_URI: '<your-graphql-uri>',
  API_KEY: '<your-api-key>',
};
```

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
